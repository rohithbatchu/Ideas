Ideas for Predictiong Natural Disasters
At first thank you for giving opportunity to participate in this competition.

   My idea to predict natural disasters through fire,water etc...

    For the people who are locating in the home mainly they get suffer from fire injuries etc...

  1.We need to adapt fire detection systems where it uses real-time analytics, reporting and geolocation to detect the presence of smoke, 
   gas or flames. 
   Plus, it automatically notifies building owners in an emergency. It’s not so far-fetched that it might also work to trigger 
   automatic response systems against an advancing blaze.
 
  2.The best emergency management to safeguard from earthquakes and tsunamis is using environment 3d models and Iot sensors with this
    we’ll not only know earlier when a disaster will strike, but also the preciseness of its impact.

  3. The best idea where every home cam use is the Earthquake Indicator by using ARDUINO KIT(since i a from electrical branch i worked 
    on this kit) with ADXL335 Accelerometer which indicates the vibrations.

These are the three ideas that i wanted to provide because it can safeguard us from natural disaster
